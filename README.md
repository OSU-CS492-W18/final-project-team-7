# Rate Catz

A masterfully crafted Android application with the main intent of pitting two cats against each other in a randomized rating roulette.
Developed for CS 492, Rate Catz will have the following:

1. Multiple activities
2. At least one implicit intent to launch an external app
3. HTTPS requests to a third-party API 
	* Optionally send data back to the API
4. Implement activity lifecycle methods to ensure clarity and flow
5. Store favorite catz in a database using SQLite
6. Polished and well-styled UI


## The Cat API 

The [Cat API](http://thecatapi.com/ "The Cat API") allows cat loving developers to randomly select cats for their app.
It references a database with easy to write queries and will return a selection of random cat image links.
This API also has functionality to allow for favoriting and voting through other specific queries.
